React-Sudoku

Sodoku generator and solver created with Javascript + React.
Currently packaged with Create-React-App.

The solver iterates over 3 methods to fill out the unsolved scenario. A fourth method is required to complete the software for the hardest (non-guess based) sudoku puzzles.

Once the solver is complete, it can be used as a tester for generating new puzzles of specified difficulty.
